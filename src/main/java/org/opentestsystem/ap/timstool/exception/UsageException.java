 * Throw this when there is an error with the data provided by the user.  If the command being executed does not have

 * Usage exception examples:  If an input file is required but cannot be found, if the output file should be a specific
 * extension like 'xml' or 'xlsx'.  This differs from {@link CommandException}.
